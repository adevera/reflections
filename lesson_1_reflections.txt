How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
by simply checking the differences clearly shown up by the output.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
by that, one could check how the program was written before, and see failures, bugs, improvements, etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It provides more flexibility and control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
it makes more sense from the programming point of view, to have files interrelated, being tracked concurrently

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
with git log you can check commits made and their id, and once found the commit we are looking for
then compare with the commit id of the previous commit by using git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you can always go back, identify when the break was introduced and fix it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it to learn about it on one side, for project management, and also as long as I am learning python language
