When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would want a remote repository mainly in two situations. Either I want to work from different places or computers
  and need to have access to my files, or there are different people collaborating in the project, so by having
  a remote repository they can also work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I might want to stay on my local branch commits, instead of incorporating other commits to my work, which would happen if there  would be an automatic pull.
